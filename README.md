# planet-fact-site

Intro
Hello! This is my solution to Planets fact site - Frontend Mentor. This is my first project build with Vue JS.
This is not the full solution as some components are missing. But it gives the idea of how to use components and there reusability. I didnt used any CSS libraries for styling so design at places is bit rough and not optimised for modifications.

Challenge

    Your challenge is to build out this 8-page planets fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

    You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local data.json file for the planets. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate .html files.

    Your users should be able to:

        View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
        See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
        View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"
